/**
 * Base trait for annotations that aggregate multiple other annotations. An aggregate annotation
 * works like an "annotation function" — applying it to a symbol behaves as if all the annotations
 * declared on its `aggregated` method were applied directly.
 *
 * To declare an aggregate, extend `AnnotationAggregate` and implement the `aggregated` method via
 * the [[reifyAggregated]] macro. The aggregated annotations must be declared on that
 * implementation method itself. The implementation must be `final`.
 *
 * Constructor parameters of the aggregate may be referenced as arguments to inner annotations and
 * will be substituted at the application site:
 *
 * {{{
 *   class customName(name: String) extends AnnotationAggregate {
 *     @name(name)
 *     final def aggregated: List[StaticAnnotation] = reifyAggregated
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * Made's annotation lookup machinery (`hasAnnotation`/`getAnnotation` on mirror elements,
 * label resolution and metadata) automatically expands aggregates so that downstream code
 * sees the underlying annotations directly.
